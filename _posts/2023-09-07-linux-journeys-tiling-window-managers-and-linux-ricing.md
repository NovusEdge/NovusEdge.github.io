Okay. So... This is a kinda follow-up blog for [the last Linux Journeys post](https://novusedge.github.io/posts/linux-journeys-customizing-the-bootsplash/). Hope you enjoy~

TL;DR: If you're only interested in the dotfiles, here you go: https://github.com/NovusEdge/dotfiles

Last week, I decided to give tiling window managers a shot. I'm a sucker for linux ricing and wanted to try my hand out at doing just that. It was a lot of fun, but I'm certain that I still have a LONG way to go before I can actually claim to be good at using them. 

## The Rice

There wasn't much of a process on how I selected what I used. For the WM, I simply searched: "Easiest tiling window manager" and found that many people recommend `i3` so that's what I chose. There's a lot of tweaks I made, but I'm still far ways from actually even remembering keybindings (I constantly have to either look up my keybindings). 

As for the other components, it was pure trial and error. I tried a bunch of stuff out and used whatever I liked and/or whatever worked for me >.>
I _highly_ recommend people interested in this stuff to go pay a visit to some of the following places:
- [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/): People show off their rices here, go check em out!
- [Jie Fang's Guide to Ricing](https://jie-fang.github.io/blog/basics-of-ricing)
- [Rizonrice's blog on this stuff](https://rizonrice.github.io/resources)
- [Lordpipe's obscure tutorials](https://lordofpipes.github.io/obscure-tutorials/docs/linux-tutorials/fedora-snapper/): I dunno how I came across this gem of a person's tutorial stash but it's GOLDEN


Well, that's all for this I guess. Thanks for reading~
