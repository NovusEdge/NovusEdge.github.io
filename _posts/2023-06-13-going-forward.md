Heyy!! 

So... Before I begin, Imma thank all the 2 readers who're reading my non-existent blogs. (Thanks for the support, love you mom!)

Now, let me get back to this post's purpose. Ever since creating this blog platform thingy, I've not particularly uploaded/posted anything. However, I refuse to believe that this is gonna be one more of those inactive projects. So, I've decided that I'm gonna try to find interesting stuff and maybe make some content out of that to post in maybe a week or something. For the people wondering if there's going to be an upload schedule, my answer is... _nope_. Each post will be uploaded whenever I'm done and satisfied with it. _However_ I will (hopefully) be posting regular writeups over here. 

I'm not sure about what to make the first "proper" post about, so I'm open to suggestions.

That's all folks!
