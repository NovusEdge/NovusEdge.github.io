Hey there folks!

You may have guessed from the title already, but yeah, I'm finally attending university! (yay~)
I got into the Lahti Campus of LUT University Finland and, well, it's been a journey just getting here. Man... it's just been a week but I already feel like a year or two have passed. I came here on the 1st, tired and excited to the bone (yeah it's my first time travelling international, alone*). My honest first reaction? Well it was something along the lines of: _"Now where the hell do I go"_.

Thankfully, I've noticed that Finnish people are just sweethearts and very happy to help you if you need it. The place _does_ seem a bit _too_ empty at times, like for example, even in the summer, when you go out on sundays at 08:00, the streets will be *empty*. Completely. Yeah there's always some random tourists that come and go, but not many people. 
> _but NoVUs hoW do YOu Expect PEOplE AT 08:00 On a SUNDAy?! trY GOinG OUT A bIT latEr or oN a WeEkDAy!!_

Yeah. Sure buddy. I set out to do some city roaming, and I was out for like 5 hours straight, even at 12:00 I barely saw a soul outside. And yeah there's _some_ people on a weekday but it's still weird to see so few people when you've spent your life on the streets of a country like India. I'm not complaining tho, I quite like the peace and quiet.

Let me tell you the perfect blunderous incident that happend when us students were told in the student's orientation:
> You students are responsible for all your studies. If you wanna attend a course you gotta register for it on time and plan your own schedules. 

Hearing this, I was quite happy. I thought, _finally, some academic freedom! I can choose whatever the fuck I wanna learn!_. I decided to take it upon myself to enroll into several different courses that interested me, they all had prerequisites so I enrolled into those too. It did not take too long for me to select a good number of courses that totaled to 180 credits that I needed to complete my studies. 

Two days passed in quite a flash of sightseeing and getting settled into a new land. It was time for the first day of university. What could go wrong? Well... not much to be honest, but it _is_ embarassing to note that I had almost 5 times the workload than all my peers for the first 2 days before one of them saw my schedule and pointed it out to me that I had taken TOO many courses _and_ enrolled in some 3rd year courses.

Yep, you read that right. I took on some 2nd and 3rd year courses, and naturally was able to keep up because I have a problem where I've spent a bit too much time with computers and less with people. 

Writing this down, I feel like it looks more like I'm bragging and not a joke like I imagined it would be; but now you know. 

Anyways, that's all I have for this update. If you enjoy my works, or find them useful, I'd be happy if you reached out to me. You could also check the ARaChn3 organization and join if you like the idea of it. 

Byee~
