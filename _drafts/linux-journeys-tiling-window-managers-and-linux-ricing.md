Last week, I decided to give tiling window managers a shot. I'm a sucker for linux ricing and wanted to try my hand out at doing just that. It was a lot of fun, but I'm certain that I still have a LONG way to go before I can actually claim to be good at using them. 

## The Rice

There wasn't much of a process on how I selected what I used. For the WM, I simply searched: "Easiest tiling window manager" and found that many people recommend `i3` so that's what I chose. There's a lot of tweaks I made, but I'm still far ways from actually even remembering keybindings (I constantly have to either look up my keybindings).
